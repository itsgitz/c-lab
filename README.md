# My C/C++ Lab

This is my lab for building software with the C programming language, just like I did in vocational high school, but now in advanced mode for the modern programming world. I've decided to learn C again because, in this era of AI, I believe web developers might be replaced by AI in the next 3 to 5 years. With C, I aim to connect more deeply with hardware.
